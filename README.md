# Predict Football Match Winners With Machine Learning And Python

This project was created as part of a tutorial by Data Quest. You can view the full tutorial on YouTube here: [Predict Football Match Winners With Machine Learning And Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0irmDBWLrco).

## Overview
This repository contains code and notebooks for predicting the outcomes of football matches using machine learning techniques. The project includes general web scraping and data preprocessing steps to gather match data, followed by the implementation of machine learning models to make predictions.

## Purpose
This project is a test case for learning:
- General web scraping techniques
- Data preprocessing and analysis
- Building and evaluating machine learning models

## Files
- **training_model.ipynb**: Contains the steps for training the machine learning model.
- **scraping.ipynb**: Demonstrates the process of web scraping match data.

## Prerequisites
To run the code in this repository, you will need:
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `beautifulsoup4`, and any other dependencies mentioned in the notebooks.

## Learning Outcomes
- Gained hands-on experience with web scraping tools and techniques.
- Understood the process of preparing raw data for machine learning.
- Applied machine learning algorithms to real-world data and evaluated their performance.
